Sharepics is a project with the goal of allowing users to submit pictures to the database.
Since I was not taught how to work with file submissions during the course at Coding Dojo,
this project demonstrates my abilities to do research, learn and apply a new topic and concept 
on my own.
The project allows users to submit a picture and add a description to the picture only if they are a 
registered user. They can also register if they are not and log in and log out after.
The project is more of a backbone for any website that allows users or clients to submit pictures
and have it displayed instead of having a Web Developer making changes and updating it to the repository
for it to reflect the changes.

This version uses the postgres database instead of the default SQLite
